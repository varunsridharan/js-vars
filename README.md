# JS Vars
This is a simple javascript ES6 library mainly developed to help ease my javascript development

But its open source and free to use in your projects.


## ⚙️Installation
The preferred way to install this extension is through [NPM][NPM].

    $ npm install @varunsridharan/js-vars --save-dev


## 🚀 Usage

```javascript
import {_map} from "@varunsridharan/js-vars"
const myarray = _map.call([1,2,3,4],(x)=> x * 2);
```

> Please refer [index.js](index.js) for list of predefined variables

> Note this library is desinged in mind with best minifycation for javascript library instead of using `Array.map` in all the places just use `_map`
